/**
 * The longest silence the worker can still be alive through.
 *
 * It commits its response headers before the provider has said anything and
 * emits nothing at all until the first visible token — reasoning time is dead
 * air by design — so a stalled turn and a thinking one look identical on the
 * wire. What bounds the honest case is the worker's own `MODEL.providerTimeoutMs`
 * (120s): a provider call that says nothing for that long is aborted and the
 * worker answers with an `error` event. A repair round resets that same budget
 * after `retrying`, so 120s is the longest legitimate gap between two chunks
 * rather than a total. The rest is margin for the abort to reach the provider
 * stream, the quota release the worker awaits before it emits, and transit.
 *
 * Past this, the connection is being held open by something that is never going
 * to answer — a buffering proxy, a wedged worker — and without a watchdog the
 * store stays `busy` for the life of the tab: the composer disabled, every chat
 * command refusing, and no Retry drawn, recoverable only by a reload.
 *
 * Deliberately not a setting. A false positive costs one Retry on an answer
 * that was still coming; there is no number a visitor could pick that is better
 * informed than the one the worker's own timeout implies.
